This project has timers for conference speakers.  Technical teams 
can configure and display the timers to help keep conference schedules. 

This project was built on the Watch utilities from Prayank Swaroop 
(prayank.swaroop@adobe.com)
It has been modified to provide several countdown timer options. 
Licensing remains the same.

This project used the Flex API to create flash videos.  
You will need to acquire the Flex compiler from Adobe. 

I used the free compiler here:
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html
(last tested with Flex SDK 4.5.1)

You will notice many duplicates that were created for various presentation times.  
TimerXXmYmZm presents a XX min timer 
at Y mins remaining the screen will turn yellow.  
at Z mins remaining the screen will turn red.

Thanks,
Billy Foss
