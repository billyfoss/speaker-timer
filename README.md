speaker-timer
=============

This project has timers for conference speakers.  Technical teams 
can configure and display the timers to help keep conference schedules. 

This project is a replacement for the flex-timers project that used 
the Flex API to create flash videos.  This project uses JavaScript to 
avoid any compiling.

Thanks,
